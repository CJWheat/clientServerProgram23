    <p>Here is a little bit about myself.</p>
    <p>I was born and raised in south Mississippi.  However, I have had the opportunity to travel throughout the country and beyond.
  I graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi in 1999 with a degree in Business.  I have worked as a service manager, a shipping manager,
  a house painter, and a teacher.  I have traveled and worked with students in Vietnam and the Philippines, but have taught mainly in Mississippi for
  the past 22 years.  <span class="emphasis">The greatest joy and privilege I have in this life is being a husband, a father, and a child of God.</span></p>
    <p>In addition to that, I would love to be able to travel more with my beautiful wife, Sofia. Below are a list of places we would like to 
      visit in the near future.</p>
  <div id="places">
    <ul>
      <li>Mindoro, Philippines</li>
      <li>Bogota, Colombia</li>
      <li>Jerusalem, Israel</li>
      <li>Rome, Italy</li>
      <li>Java, Indonesia</li>
